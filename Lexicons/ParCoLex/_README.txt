### ParCoLex Morphosyntacitc Lexicon of Serbian ###

ParCoLex is a compilation of two preexisting lexicons: Wikimorph-sr () and srLex (latest version: https://www.clarin.si/repository/xmlui/handle/11356/1073. Version used here: https://github.com/uzh/reldi/tree/master/lexicons). It contains some 7M entries in the form of triples <inflected form, lemma, morphosyntactic description>. The morphosyntactic tags used are the same as in the Wikimorph-sr lexicon. Consequently, the srLex tags were converted towards the same tagset. For more details, see the documentation of Wikimorph-sr.
