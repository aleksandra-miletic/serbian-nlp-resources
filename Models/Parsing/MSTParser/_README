### MST Parser model for graph-based parsing of Serbian ###

The model parcotrainsynt-80k-mstparser.model was developed using the MST Parser (https://github.com/travisbrown/mstparser). It was trained on a 80K portion of the ParCoTrain-Synt corpus of Serbian (https://github.com/aleksandra-miletic/serbian-nlp-resources/tree/master/ParCoTrain-Synt). The training was done on second-order features with non-projective decoding. Therefore, the parsing using this model should be done in same conditions.

If you compiled your MST parser using Ant, you can launch the model as follows:

$  java -classpath "./output/classes:lib/trove.jar" -Xmx15G mstparser.DependencyParser test test-file:corpus_to_parse.conll model-name:parcotrainsynt-80k-mstparser.model decode-type:non-proj order:2 output-file:parsing_output.conll

Note that in order for the model to work, the corpus file needs to be annotated using the same morphosyntactic tags as in the trainging corpus on which the model was trained. For more details on this, see the ParCoTrain-Synt corpus and the associated annotation guides (in French). 

### Performance
In our experiments, this model achieved 86,62 LAS and 90,43 UAS on the test section of the ParCoTrain-Synt corpus (v0.1). Note that the evaluation was done using gold standard morphosyntactic annotation.
