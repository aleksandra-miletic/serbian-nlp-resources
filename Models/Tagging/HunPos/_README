## HunPos Model for tagging Serbian 

The model parcotrainsynt_80k_hunpos.model is a POS-tagging model trained using the HunPos tagger (https://code.google.com/archive/p/hunpos/). HunPos is a trigram-based HMM tagger. The model distributed here was trained on a 80K token corpus of contemporary Serbian. Details below.

### Training corpus

80 405 tokens of the ParCoTrain-Synt corpus (v0.1). 
2917 sentences
711 tags

The model was trained on the detailed morphosyntactic tags, which explains the high number of tags. 

### Performance

In our experiments, the model achieves an average accuracy of 85% on the full morphosyntactic tags.
For more information on the tagset used, see the annotation guide of the corpus (https://github.com/aleksandra-miletic/serbian-nlp-resources/tree/master/ParCoTrain-Synt) (in French). 
A documentatation in Serbian and English will soon be made available.

### Usage

In order to launch the model on a new Serbian text, do the following in the HunPos directory: 

$ cat new_text.txt | ./hunpos-tag parcotrainsynt_80k_hunpos.model
